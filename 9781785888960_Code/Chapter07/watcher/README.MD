# Watcher

Install and run:

```
npm i
npm start

You will need to create an administrator dashboard first. Open a browser to `localhost:2112/admin/adminname`.

This dashboard will report time series information about activities in clients.

Create two new browser windows, and navigate each to `localhost:2112`

Move your mouse around in each of these windows, creating activity.

Go back to your admin dashboard. You should see two time series graphs being updated in realtime. Keep moving your mouse around in clients...
